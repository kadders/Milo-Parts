# Soft Jaws Documentation

## Overview
The Soft Jaws are designed to provide gentle but secure workholding for delicate or finished parts. They protect workpieces from marring or damage that might occur with standard metal jaws, while still maintaining precision during machining operations.

## Material Requirements
- **Quantity**: 2 pieces (1 pair)
- **Stock Material**: Aluminum 6061-T6 (recommended for durability and precision)
- **Fasteners**: 
  - 2x M10x30mm Counter-Sunk Screws (for mounting to vice, per jaw)

## Features
- Non-marring surface for delicate workpieces
- Custom profiles can be machined into the jaws for specific part geometries
- Compatible with the [Vice Collection](../vice-collection/) vices
- Replaceable design for when jaws become worn or damaged

## Installation Instructions
1. Remove the existing jaw faces from the vise.
2. Align the soft jaws with the mounting holes on the vice.
3. Secure using the M10x30mm Counter-Sunk Screws.
4. Ensure the jaws are properly seated and tightened before use.

## Customization
The soft jaws can be machined to create custom profiles for specific workpieces:
- Use the machining resources provided in [Machining Resources.md](Machining%20Resources.md) for tooling and machining steps that worked well for the soft jaws.
- Follow the recommended toolpaths and settings for optimal results
- Consider creating multiple sets of soft jaws for different workpiece geometries

## Maintenance
- Regularly inspect the soft jaws for wear, damage, or embedded chips
- Clean the jaw surfaces after each use to prevent material buildup
- Replace when worn or damaged to maintain precision in workholding
