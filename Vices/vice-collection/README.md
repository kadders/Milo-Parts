# Vice Collection Documentation

![Vice Collection CAD Model](vice-collection-cad.jpg)

## Overview
The Vice Collection includes a complete set of vice bases and vice jaws (both small and large) designed for precision workholding in machining operations. These components provide reliable clamping force while maintaining accuracy for various machining tasks.

## Components
- **Vice Bases**:
  - **Small Sliding Base**: Compact sliding foundation for smaller workpieces
  - **Large Sliding Base**: Full-sized sliding foundation for larger projects
  - **Small Rigid Base**: Fixed compact base for maximum stability with smaller stock footprint.
  - **Large Rigid Base**: Fixed full-sized base for maximum stability with larger stock footprint.
- **Vice Jaws**: For holding larger workpieces

## Material Requirements
- **Vice Bases**: Aluminum 6061-T6 (for lightweight rigidity and excellent machinability)
   - **Small Base**: 25x50x100mm
   - **Large Base**: 50x50x150mm
- **Vice Jaws**: Aluminum 6061-T6 (for lightweight rigidity and excellent machinability)
   - **Jaws**: 25x50x100mm
- **Double Jaws**: Aluminum 6061-T6 (for lightweight rigidity and excellent machinability)
   - **Double Jaws**: 25x75x100mm
- **Fasteners**: 
  - M10x30mm Socket Head Cap Screws (for mounting vice jaws to vice base)
  - M5x12mm Socket Head Cap Screws (for mounting jaw faces, these are called out in the jaw face documentation)

## Features
- Compatible with [Soft Jaws](../Soft-Jaws/) for delicate parts
- Replaceable [Jaw Faces](../jaw-faces/) for when surfaces become worn
- Can be used with the [Angle Vice Plate](../Angle%20Vice%20Plate/) for angled setups

## Installation Instructions
1. Clean the machine table surface thoroughly
2. Align the vice base with T-slots on the machine table
3. Secure using appropriate T-slot nuts and bolts
4. Verify the vice is properly aligned using a dial indicator
5. Install desired jaw faces as needed for the specific operation

## Maintenance
- Regularly clean and lubricate moving parts
- Check for wear on jaw faces and replace as needed
- Verify alignment periodically to ensure continued precision
- Remove chips and debris after each use
